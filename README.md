# Churn-Prediction-ANN
# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN 

This project demonstrates a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built using Python and Keras to predict customer churn based on behavioral and demographic data.


## About the Project

Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to retain valuable customers.  
This ANN model classifies whether a customer will leave the service (churn) or not, using features like credit score, tenure, balance, age, and more.


## Tech Stack

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn



## Dataset

- Publicly available customer churn dataset (from Kaggle / in zip format).
- Includes customer information such as:
  - Credit Score
  - Geography
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Tenure
  - Balance
  - Number of Products
  - IsActiveMember
  - Estimated Salary
  - Churn Label (Exited)
